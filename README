TWRP device tree for Sony Xperia 1 II (pdx203)
========================================================

Based on twrp_sony_pdx201, thanks sjllls

** Building **

Do once (fixes an error during repo init):
```
mkdir -p ~/.bin
PATH="${HOME}/.bin:${PATH}"
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/.bin/repo
chmod a+rx ~/.bin/repo
```

```
repo init --depth=1 -u https://github.com/minimal-manifest-twrp/platform_manifest_twrp_aosp.git -b twrp-11
```

Then, place `r11.xml` in `.repo/local_manifests/`, then run

```
repo sync -c
export ALLOW_MISSING_DEPENDENCIES=true
source ./build/envsetup.sh
lunch aosp_r11-userdebug
mka recoveryimage
```

for some reason I had to copy `prebuilt/*` to `out/target/product/r11/`?

`out/target/product/pdx203/recovery.img` will be the fastbootable/flashable image.

```
sudo fastboot flash recovery out/target/product/pdx203/recovery.img
sudo fastboot reboot recovery
```
